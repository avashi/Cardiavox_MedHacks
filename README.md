The Android Studio project is just a UI. Basically the goal was to be able to use a device like a stethoscope or a good enough mobile app
that can record the sound of your heart beat. Then, the app sends an http request to a google cloud platform that we have setup
where the audio file would be processed. The model on the cloud platform would then use the audio file to predict and determine with high accuracy 
the type of hear rythm you have. This provides an easy and accessible way for people around the world who have access to a $3 3D printed stethoscope,
smart phone with our app, and wifi service to be able to create a basic diagnosis of their heart beat, which could save a trip to the doctor
or it could alert you of health problems. This could also be used by resident doctors who do not have as much experience and need
real-time feedback about a patient's heart beat.
